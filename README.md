# Image_recognition_projects
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and MobileNetV2 to classify images into categories (e.g., Cat vs. Dog). It includes image preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation steps. Ideal for learning or deploying image recognition systems using TensorFlow/Keras.
